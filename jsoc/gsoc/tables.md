## Implement Flashfill in Julia 

**Difficulty**: Medium

*FlashFill* is mechanism for creating data manipulation pipelines using programming by example (PBE). As an example see this [implementation in Microsoft Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-flash-fill-in-excel-3f9bcf1e-db93-4890-94a0-1578341f73f7). We want a version of Flashfill that can work against Julia tabular data structures, such as DataFrames and Tables.

**Recommended Skills**: Compiler techniques, DSL generation, Program synthesis

**Expected Output**: A practical flashfill implementation that can be used on any tablular data structure in Julia

## Parquet.jl enhancements

**Difficulty**: Medium

[Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is a binary data format for tabular data. It has features for compression and memory-mapping of datasets on disk. A decent implementation of Parquet in Julia is likely to be highly performant. It will be useful as a standard format for distributing tabular data in a binary format. There exists a Parquet.jl package that has a Parquet reader and a writer. It currently conforms to the Julia Tabular file IO interface at a very basic level. It needs more work to add support for critical elements that would make Parquet.jl usable for fast large scale parallel data processing. One or more of the following goals can be targeted:

* Lazy loading and support for out-of-core processing, with Arrow.jl and Tables.jl integration. Improved usability and performace of Parquet reader and writer for large files.
* Reading from and writing data on to cloud data stores, including support for partitioned data.
* Support for missing data types and encodings making the Julia implementation fully featured.

**Recommended skills:** Good knowledge of Julia language, Julia data stack and writing performant Julia code.

**Expected Results:** Depends on the specific projects we would agree on.

## GPU support in JuliaDB

JuliaDB is a distributed analytical database. It uses Julia’s multi-processing for parallelism at the moment. GPU implementations of some operations may allow relational algebra with low latency. In this project, you will be required to add basic GPU support in JuliaDB.

@@tight-list
- Copy a table to GPU -- this may be as simple as converting every column into a CuArray or GPUArray
- `map`, `reduce` and `filter` operation -- apply simple functions on a large table that is on the GPU
  - Ensure that columnar storage format is made use of in the lower level code generated.
- The `groupby` and `join` operations may involve first implementing an efficient [`sortperm`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/sort/#Base.sortperm) that utilize the GPU, or an efficient hash table on the GPU
- `groupby` kernel on GPU
- `join` kernel on GPU (stretch goal)

## A columnar query processing and optimization backend for Query.jl

[Query.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/Query.jl) is designed to work
with multiple backends. This project would add a backend for columnar sources
that implements many of the optimizations that the database literature
on column oriented query processing has identified.

**Recommended Skills**: Very strong database design knowledge, familiarity
with the Julia data stack and excellent Julia knowledge.

**Expected Results**: A new backend for [Query.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/Query.jl)
that runs queries against columnar stores in an optimized way.

## Tabular file IO

The Queryverse has a large number of file IO packages: [CSVFiles.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/CSVFiles.jl),
[ExcelFiles.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/ExcelFiles.jl), [FeatherFiles.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/FeatherFiles.jl),
[StatFiles.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/StatFiles.jl), [ParquetFiles](https://github.com/queryverse/ParquetFiles.jl)
and [FstFiles.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/FstFiles.jl). This project
will a) do serious performance work across all of the existing packages and
b) add write capabilities  to a number of them.

**Recommended Skills**: Experience with file formats, writing performant
julia code.

**Expected Results**: Write capabilities across the packages listed above,
competitive performance for all the packages listed above.
